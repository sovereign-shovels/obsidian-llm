## Identity

This repo is **obsidian-llm** — part of the [sovereign-shovels](../README.md) portfolio.

- **Substrate anchor:** Obsidian
- **Utility category:** llm
- **Tagline:** The only Obsidian-AI plugin that doesn't require a vendor account.
- **Sprint:** 4
- **Estimated build for v0.1:** 3–4 weeks for v0.1

The substrate this shovel rides is: Obsidian / Logseq selfhost crowd who want AI without vendor lock-in

The launch channels are: r/ObsidianMD, r/logseq, r/PKMS, Obsidian community forums, HN

---

## Philosophy this repo lives by

Read the universal philosophy: [[../PHILOSOPHY|Philosophy]].

In short, every shovel must satisfy all five rules:

1. **Substrate-anchored name** ✓ (this is `obsidian-llm`)
2. **Sovereign by construction** — user owns model choice, BYO endpoint, must work with local-only
3. **Real demand evidence** — gap is documented, not assumed
4. **Buildable in 1–3 weeks** — v0.1 estimate is 3–4 weeks for v0.1
5. **Scope-evolution headroom** — see PRD-v1 for v0.1 → v0.5 → v1.0

---

## STRICT NO-NOS — do not violate any of these

### Universal (inherited from [[../NO-NOS|NO-NOS]])

1. NO hardcoded API keys, vendor URLs, or model names in code outside config files.
2. NO default that requires a sign-up upstream. Tool must work with a local model.
3. NO telemetry, phone-home, or analytics by default.
4. NO closed-source runtime dependencies that compromise sovereignty.
5. NO scope creep into "agent platform" or "general assistant" territory.
6. NO fake claims of being official upstream tooling.
7. NO breaking config changes in v0.x without printed migration path.
8. NO maintenance promises in README. "Best-effort community shovel."
9. NO PRs merged without working tests.
10. NO publishing v1.0 without PRD-v1 acceptance criteria met.

### Specific to obsidian-llm

1. Never default to any cloud endpoint. Default config: local Ollama at localhost:11434.
2. Plugin must work with vault completely offline (with a local model).
3. Never index vault contents to any external service.

### Anti-scope (what NOT to build, ever, in this repo)

Not a replacement for Obsidian. Not a writing assistant. Not a graph-rendering tool. AI integration only.

## How to operate here

When you (the agent) start work in this repo:

1. **Read** [[PRD-v1]] before writing any code.
2. **Read** [[../PHILOSOPHY|Philosophy]] and [[../NO-NOS|NO-NOS]] if you haven't this session.
3. **Update** [[progress]] after each significant change. Update the YAML
   frontmatter — the root [[../PORTFOLIO]] view aggregates from it.
4. **If a decision conflicts with this AGENTS.md**, STOP and ask the human.
5. **If a user asks for something that violates a no-no**, push back. Don't comply.
6. **Commits** follow conventional commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, etc.).
7. **Branches**: `main` is protected. Work on `feat/<thing>` branches and PR.
8. **Tests** are required for any code path that ships in v0.1.

## Tombstone watch

What could kill this shovel:

Existing Obsidian AI plugins (Smart Connections, Copilot for Obsidian) shipping sovereign mode. Possible — the differentiator is ONLY sovereignty.

What we're watching for:

Obsidian themselves shipping a first-party AI feature. Watch their roadmap.

If the kill signal triggers, notify the human before taking further action.
